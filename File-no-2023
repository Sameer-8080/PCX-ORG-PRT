Client: "Hey, I'm experiencing a critical issue on our e-commerce website. When customers try to add items to their shopping cart, 
the system is not updating in real-time. The cart seems to be lagging, and customers are getting confused because they don't see the items they added immediately. 
This is affecting our sales as users are abandoning their carts. Can you look into this urgently?"
